## Example Plugin ##
This plugin adds a new page which is accessible via the navigation panel on the left.

The page contains a heading saying "Example Page", followed by some random Latin.

This writing is generated from the README.md file in the base directory of the plugin.

I hope this inspires someone to see what they can make. There are plenty of hooks and many ways you can make something awesome and powerful.

Good luck, adventurer!
